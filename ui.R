              project intended for local use by HMIS Administrators in Continuums
              of Care (CoCs) around the U.S. and its territories. Eva is designed
              to help you assess the accuracy and completeness of the data within
              your HMIS. In future iterations it will also assist communities in
              analyzing HMIS performance data, including coordinated entry, if 
              your community utilizes HMIS for this purpose. Use of this tool is
              not required by HUD.</p>
              <p>Eva is a web-based tool built with R Shiny. This means:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Eva will only access your CoC&rsquo;s data during your session, 
                <strong>no CoC data is being retained or viewed by anyone besides 
                you.</strong> Eva does retain metadata about the upload file itself, 
                such as the name of your software vendor, your export dates, hash 
                status, and data source information. This is collected for 
                troubleshooting and tool planning purposes.

              a .zip file with 23 csv files in it.

              <li>A hashed export means that the personal identifiers are obscured
              when the export is generated.</li>
              <li>The HMIS CSV Export has client-level data in it, so it must be
              stored in a secure location per HUD, state, and local rules and

              on the top right of the screen. This toggle will be available from
              every page in Eva. Please note that you can turn Demo Mode off or
              on at any time, the application will just ask you to confirm your

              dataset. <strong>If you wish to see your results again you will need to
              re-upload your hashed HMIS CSV Export file.</strong> To do so, you
              need to turn off Demo Mode. This will clear the sample HMIS data
              from the application so you can operate Eva as normal and upload
              your own HMIS data again.</p></div>

              button. Once you find the zip file on your computer, select it 
              and click \'Open\'. Your file will begin uploading. Eva will check 
              to determine if the export is hashed. If it is not, Eva will reject 
              the file with an error message, and clear Eva's memory until you 
              upload a hashed HMIS CSV Export.</p>
              
              <h4>HMIS CSV Export File Structure Analysis</h4>
              <p>Once Eva verifies that your export is hashed, it will check
              that the files have all the right names, columns, data types, and
              allowable values. Eva will generate data quality issues that are
              categorized as high priority errors, general errors, and warnings.
              If there are any high priority errors that prevent Eva from
              functioning, Eva will reject your upload, stop processing the export,
              and clear Eva's memory.</p>
              <p>All issues will display in the HMIS CSV File Structure Analysis
              panel, where you can download the details, even if the file
              was rejected. Users should contact their vendor to resolve high 
              priority errors identified in the HMIS CSV Export File Structure
              Analysis, as well as any other structural issues which you feel need
              to be corrected. Not all structural issues found in this analysis will 
              prevent the data from being accepted for analysis, so they may not 
              require immediate attention. Once your vendor has addressed any
              high priority structural errors, you can attempt another upload.</p>
              
              <p>Once you have uploaded a hashed and structurally sound zip file,
              you will see a confirmation that your upload was successful, the date

               <h4>Client Counts Report</h4>
               <p>The Client Counts Report provides the number of households/clients
               who have been served in each project and their enrollment status
               at the time of CSV Export generation. This report can be used to
               verify that a project is up to date on their HMIS data entry by
               comparing counts reported with the number of households/clients
               that are known to be served in each project. Permanent housing
               projects can check that the number of households/clients who have
               not yet moved into housing is correct.</p>
               
               <h4>Inputs</h4>
               <p>Select a project from the drop list and adjust the the Date
               Range for the cohort of clients you want to see reported. The
               Date Range defaults to the date range covered by the HMIS CSV Export. 
               Users are encouraged to edit the Date Range as desired to see
               metrics for timeframes within the Export period, such as the
               number of households/clients who exited during that timeframe
               with and without a Move-In Date. Note that setting the Start Date
               to the Export End Date will show the current status for all
               enrollments for the project.</p>
               
               <h4>Summary</h4>
               <p>The Summary panel provides a count of households/clients who
               have statuses of the following within the selected project:
               <ul>
               <li>Active No Move-In Date</li>
               <li>Currently Moved In</li>

               <li>Exited Project</li>
               </ul>
               
               <h4>Client Counts Detail</h4>
               <p>In this panel you will see the Personal ID, Relationship to HoH,
               Entry Date, Move-In Date, Exit Date, and the Status for each client
               served by the selected project within the Date Range selected. The
               rows are ordered by Entry Date (oldest on top), Household ID (not
               visible), and Personal ID. This enables users to see the oldest
               enrollments first and groups clients in the same household
               together. All columns are searchable. For example, to find all
               enrollments with a Status of \'Active No Move-In Date\', you can
               type \'act\' in the Status search bar and the data table will
               react and filter in that way.

               so they can work on correcting their data. Feel free to modify, 
               add, or remove anything as you see fit. For example, you may want

               easily remove any tabs that may distract your users from that goal.
               Please note that Overlaps will be shown in the 'Warnings' tab and

               organizations may benefit from additional assistance and where

               for reporting to interested entities about your overall HMIS
               system data quality.</p>
               <p>Click the Download button to generate an Excel workbook with
               the your entire system's Data Quality data. Feel free to modify,
               add, or remove anything as you see fit. For example, if you are
               sending this workbook to your CoC management, you may want to 
               remove the tabs that have client-level data on them.

               and Warnings) you will find two plots: one plots the counts of
               issues and one plots the number of issues by organization.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Issues</b></h5>
               <p>Across all of the organizations in your upload, this plot shows
               the <b>top 10</b> issues identified in the data quality scan. This
               result can help to focus future end-user trainings and bring to
               light any potential considerations in your federal or local
               reporting and analysis.</p>
               
               <h5><b>Top 10 Organizations</b></h5>
               <p>These plots show the <b>top 10</b> organizations across your
               system with the highest number of issues identified. You can use
               these plots to help determine which organizations may need extra
               assistance in getting their HMIS Errors/Warnings resolved.</p>
